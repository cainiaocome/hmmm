UFW

1. run as non-priveledged user
If you want to run ufw without root, you may install libcap2-bin firstly and
do a little configuration:

cp /usr/share/doc/libcap2-bin/examples/capability.conf /etc/security/
echo cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw `whoami` >> /etc/security/capability.conf

Sometimes it may require relogin to enable pam_cap.so.

2. no rst
You may want to prevent kernel from sending rst for inbound syn/ack by

make norst

3. install
make
make install

will install one file to /usr/sbin/ufw. 

If you want line output with full ip addresses and ports format, you can make 
with DEFINES=-D_PACKET_FULLADDR.

4. make parse-test
to test line interpreter separately.
